# wave-reducer
Sandbox for generating wave-reducer for robot joints


## Preventing self-intersecting profile:


- Increase $a + b$: Increase the distance of the rolling elements from the eccentric point (make the crank or roller larger).    
- Reduce $z$: Reduce the number of teeth (though this changes your transmission ratio).    
- Reduce $e$: Reduce the eccentricity (this makes the "wave" shallower).    
- Reduce $b$: Reduce the radius of the rolling elements (this reduces the offset distance $q$).
